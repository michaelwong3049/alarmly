# Alarmly

Alarmly is a iOS mobile application aimed at pushing notifications once you have arrived at your desired location, waking you up from your sleepy commute to class early in the morning.

## Why Did I Create Alarmly?

Over theÂ years, I found my friend always falling asleep on the train on his 1+ hour commute, always missing his stop while on the train. I decided to make an application that sends iOS push notifications once you have arrived at your location.
